\section{Reflective Summary of Team Work}

Team work was an essential part of the project, and an area where my group 
excelled. Each individual was allowed to select their own areas of the project 
to work on, and furthermore regular meetings and code review sessions both ensured 
that no individual was overwhelmed, and ensured that contributions to the 
solution were of the highest quality. 
\par\bigskip\noindent
The group solution achieved every point of the specification in an elegant 
manner, and had a wealth of additional functionality through additions to the 
project. 
Examples of these additions could include; the ability to synthesise music and 
play back multiple notes on each channel and multiple channels simultaneously, 
an improved user interaction via a shell style interface complete with the 
ability to adjust settings and change mode of operation without reinstalling the 
device, or a more realistic sounding audio playback through the use of attack-
delay-sustain-release models. 

\section{Reflective Summary of Individual Work}

My individual extension project was the implementation of a Linux style shell, 
enabling user interaction with the mbed board using a computer monitor and 
keyboard via serial communication. The addition of the shell style interface 
provided a wide range of valuable tools, and a great degree of control over the 
host board. Examples of the control given includes: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item The ability to play notes
    \item The ability to change the device volume
    \item the ability to write custom text to the LCD display 
    \item The ability to change which channel of music is being listened to
    \item The ability to view useful information, such as the track name, channel,
or what notes are currently being played
    \item The ability to view CAN packets as they are received on the CAN bus 
    \item The ability to scroll text on the LCD display 
\end{itemize}
This enabled a great degree of control over the host board, and provided 
invaluable tools throughout the course of the project. This extension project 
was initially very challenging and was an ambitious task to undertake due to the 
scale of the implementation combined with any desired features. However, the end 
result was very rewarding and one that I can be proud of.
