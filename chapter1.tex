\section{Summary of project work}
The Second Year Embedded Systems Project was a ten week project, undertaken 
for the duration of Spring Term 2014-2015. The project was a primarily a 
group task, completed in groups consisting of four members. However, there 
was also the capability for individual extensions to the main body of the 
project, allowing each member to showcase competency and creativity.

The group project involved programming an ARM LPC1768 'MBED' microcontroller, 
situated on top of a board of peripheral accessories, in order to 
generate and play music on a user selectable channel corresponding to data 
being sent down a Controlled Area Network bus (CAN bus). The individual 
component was not specified, and was instead left up to each individual to 
decide on an extension project, research, and implement it. 

The groups solution was very complete, not only matching the full spec, but also
extending the implementation to a high degree, producing a user friendly, good 
sounding end product. 

My individual extension provided a more user friendly interface than the 
rudimentary keypad attached to the MBED board through the implementation of a 
shell type interface, allowing the user to input commands, and adjust settings
though the use of the computer keyboard and monitor. 
 
\section{Experiences as a team}
The team aspect of the project was one that worked particularly well
\section{Expectations and actual outcomes}
\section{What is in the report}
This report sets out to provide a description of our team solution to the set 
assignment, as well as highlighting areas of individual contribution throughout.
The report will begin with a technical description of the set problem, 
including a discussion of requirements and technical challenges that may be 
faced in the meeting of these requirements. 
Following a description of the problem, the group solution will be discussed. 
The discussion will highlight how each section of the requirements has been met 
by the implemented solution, as well as detailing how the problem has been broken 
down for each individual member, presenting each members implementation and 
technical innovation. 
After a discussion of the group's solution, the appropriate testing strategies 
and methods that were used throughout the project will be examined in detail, 
providing feedback on how they have proved useful, and incorporating a 
discussion on a professional/social/ethical/environmental aspect of the solution.
The report will then focus critically on my individual implementation, 
detailing the technical innovation, implementation, and testing undergone for my 
contribution. 
Finally the report will conclude with a reflective summary of work 
undertaken, considering which aspects of the project went smoothly, which areas
did not go as smoothly, how this might be improved in future, and what lessons 
can be taken away from the completion of the project.
