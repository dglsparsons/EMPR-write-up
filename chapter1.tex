\section{What is in the report}
This report sets out to provide a description of our team solution to the set 
assignment, as well as highlighting areas of individual contribution throughout.
The report will begin with a technical description of the set problem, 
including a discussion of requirements and technical challenges that may be 
faced in the meeting of these requirements. 
Following a description of the problem, the group solution will be discussed. 
The discussion will highlight how each section of the requirements has been met 
by the implemented solution, as well as detailing how the problem has been broken 
down for each individual member, presenting each members implementation and 
technical innovation. 
After a discussion of the group's solution, the appropriate testing strategies 
and methods that were used throughout the project will be examined in detail, 
providing feedback on how they have proved useful, and incorporating a 
discussion on a professional/social/ethical/environmental aspect of the solution.
The report will then focus critically on my individual implementation, 
detailing the technical innovation, implementation, and testing undergone for my 
contribution. 
Finally the report will conclude with a reflective summary of work 
undertaken, considering which aspects of the project went smoothly, which areas
did not go as smoothly, how this might be improved in future, and what lessons 
can be taken away from the completion of the project.
