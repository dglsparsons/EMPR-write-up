\section{Description of Problem and Requirements}
The Embedded Systems Project consisted of two main sections: a group solution 
to a predetermined problem, and an individual extension to the group's work, 
left up to each person to determine. Both sections of the project involved 
embedded systems software development in the C programming language. 

The target platform of the development is an ARM-based microcontroller, 
situated on a board of peripheral accessories. The microcontroller consists of 
an interface board coupled with the ARM cortex-M3 based LPC1768, providing easy 
interaction via USB cable to transfer binaries, and simplifying the process of 
serial communication [how-mbed-works].
