\section{Description of Individual Component Solution}
My individual contribution to the project consisted primarily of a shell style 
interface for the host board, allowing user interaction via a computer keyboard 
and monitor, but also consisted of the modification and extension of previously 
existing LCD screen code, to allow a much greater degree of control over the 
attched LCD display. 

The shell style interface was set up using an interrupt based system from the 
computer. This enables users to enter commands through any input method for 
the computer and process them on the device. This method also allows the user
to display useful information through the computer monitor.
